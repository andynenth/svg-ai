Subject: Request for Credit on Unexpected AWS Charges

Dear AWS Billing Support,

I hope you are doing well. My name is [Your Name], and I am a student preparing a portfolio while searching for my first job. I recently spun up a few AWS instances to showcase an SVG-to-SVG AI conversion project. Unfortunately, the costs for these resources ended up being higher than I anticipated, and I did not realize the billing impact in time.

Would it be possible to receive a credit or refund for the recent charges associated with this usage? I am eager to keep learning AWS, but as a student my budget is limited, and this help would make a big difference.

Thank you very much for considering my request. I appreciate your time and understanding, and I will be more careful with future usage.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
