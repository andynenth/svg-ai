# CLASSIFICATION_DAY5_EXTENDED: ULTRATHINK Neural Network Recovery Plan

**Status**: Extension to Day 5 - Addressing Neural Network Training Failures
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Required before Day 6 Hybrid System
**Goal**: Achieve >90% neural network accuracy to enable Day 6 hybrid system
**Current Issue**: 25% accuracy with severe class prediction bias (only predicts "complex" class)

---

## Problem Analysis

### Current Neural Network Status:
- ❌ **Accuracy**: 25% (Target: >85%)
- ❌ **Class Bias**: Only predicts "complex" class (100% complex, 0% others)
- ❌ **Training Environment**: CPU-only, batch_size=4
- ❌ **Convergence**: Failed due to resource constraints
- ❌ **Day 6 Blocker**: Cannot proceed with hybrid system

### Root Causes Identified:
1. **Computational Limitations**: CPU training prevents proper convergence
2. **Class Prediction Bias**: Standard cross-entropy loss insufficient
3. **Small Batch Size**: batch_size=4 prevents proper gradient estimation
4. **Basic Architecture**: Standard EfficientNet without logo-specific adaptations
5. **Training Instabilities**: Loss spikes during progressive unfreezing
