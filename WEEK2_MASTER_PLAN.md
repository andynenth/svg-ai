# WEEK 2: Image Feature Extraction - Master Plan

## Overview

This document provides the master plan for **Week 2 (2.1 Image Feature Extraction)** of the AI-enhanced SVG conversion pipeline. Each day has been split into its own detailed document for better organization.

**Week 2 Goal**: Build complete feature extraction pipeline with rule-based classification
**Duration**: 5 working days (Monday-Friday)
**Success Criteria**: Feature extraction + classification pipeline processing images in <0.5s with >80% accuracy

---

## **PRE-WEEK SETUP** (15 minutes)

### **Environment Verification Checklist**
- [x] Verify Phase 1 completion: `git tag | grep phase1` ‚úÖ phase1-complete tag found
- [x] Confirm in virtual environment: `echo $VIRTUAL_ENV` (should show venv39) ‚úÖ /Users/nrw/python/svg-ai/venv39
- [x] Test AI dependencies: `python3 scripts/verify_ai_setup.py` ‚ö†Ô∏è Core dependencies working (PyTorch, sklearn, OpenCV), minor issues with deap/transformers (non-blocking for Week 2)
- [x] Verify current directory: `pwd` (should be `/Users/nrw/python/svg-ai`) ‚úÖ Correct directory
- [x] Check git status: `git status` (should be clean on master or phase1-foundation) ‚úÖ Clean working tree on master
- [x] Create Week 2 branch: `git checkout -b week2-feature-extraction` ‚úÖ Branch created and switched
- [x] Verify test data available: `ls data/logos/` (should contain test images) ‚úÖ Found abstract, complex, gradients, simple_geometric, text_based

**Verification**: ‚úÖ Core AI dependencies working for Week 2, clean git state, test data available, Week 2 branch ready
