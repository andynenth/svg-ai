ðŸš€ COLAB DATASET UPLOAD INSTRUCTIONS
=====================================

Follow these steps to upload your logo dataset to Google Colab:

STEP 1: PREPARE LOCAL DATASET
-----------------------------
1. Navigate to your svg-ai project directory:
   cd /Users/nrw/python/svg-ai

2. Create a compressed dataset from your raw logos:
   python scripts/colab_dataset_uploader.py --create-zip

3. This will create: colab_logo_dataset.zip (~50-100MB)

STEP 2: UPLOAD TO COLAB
-----------------------
1. Open the Enhanced_Logo_Classification_Colab.ipynb notebook
2. In the "Dataset Upload & Organization" section, run:
   from google.colab import files
   uploaded = files.upload()

3. Select and upload the colab_logo_dataset.zip file
4. The notebook will automatically extract and organize the data

STEP 3: VERIFY UPLOAD
---------------------
After upload, you should see:
âœ… Found 800+ raw logo images
âœ… Intelligent organization: 200 images per class
âœ… Train/Val/Test splits created: 70%/20%/10%

ALTERNATIVE: GOOGLE DRIVE METHOD
--------------------------------
1. Upload colab_logo_dataset.zip to your Google Drive
2. In Colab, mount Google Drive and copy:
   !cp "/content/drive/MyDrive/colab_logo_dataset.zip" .
   !unzip colab_logo_dataset.zip

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
- Upload timeout: Use Google Drive method for large files
- Extraction errors: Ensure zip file is not corrupted
- Missing images: Verify data/raw_logos contains PNG files
- Permission errors: Check Colab file access permissions

- Total images: 800 (organized from 2,069 raw images)
- Classes: Simple (200), Text (200), Gradient (200), Complex (200)
- Train: 560 images (70%)
