# Archived: Scattered Planning Documents

**Date Archived:** September 30, 2024
**Reason:** Random folder structure cleanup

## What Was Archived

These folders contained 28+ planning documents that were created with confusing folder structure:

### Original Scattered Folders:
- `api-enhancement-original/` - Main Week 5-6 API enhancement plans
- `frontend-integration-original/` - Additional frontend work documents
- `phase3-api-enhancement-testing-original/` - Testing framework documents
- `phase3-ai-pipeline-integration-original/` - Integration planning documents

### Issue with Original Structure:
- Random naming convention
- Scattered across multiple phase folders
- Confusing organization
- Duplicate/overlapping content

## Current Status

**Replaced with:** `docs/phase2-core-ai/3.2_API_ENHANCEMENT_BRIEF.md`

This single concise document summarizes the entire "3.2 API Enhancement (Week 5-6)" plan with:
- Clear overview of what the plan does
- Business rationale for why it's needed
- Technical approach and success criteria
- Timeline and implementation details

## Key Planning Insight Preserved

**Main Concept:** Enhance existing Flask backend + HTML/JS frontend with AI capabilities while maintaining 100% backward compatibility.

**Strategy:** "ENHANCE, NOT REPLACE" - Add AI features as optional toggles to existing workflow.
