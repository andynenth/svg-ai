    assert deployment_health['containers_healthy'] == True
    assert deployment_health['services_responsive'] == True

    # Test intelligent routing system
    routing_performance = test_intelligent_routing()
    assert routing_performance['avg_decision_time'] < 0.01  # <10ms
    assert routing_performance['accuracy'] > 0.90  # >90% correct method selection

    # Test complete system under load
